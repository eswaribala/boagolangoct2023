Configuring MySQL Server and Setting Root Password

Open a terminal.

Change the directory to /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d using the cd command:

terminal
 cd /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d

Edit the MySQL configuration file, mysqld.cnf, using the nano text editor. You'll need superuser (sudo) privileges to edit this file:

terminal
 sudo nano mysqld.cnf

Within the configuration file, you will need to comment out or disable the password validation plugin. Locate the line with "password=" and comment it out by adding a "#" symbol at the beginning of the line. It should look like this:

terminal
# password= root

Save your changes by pressing Ctrl + O, then press Enter to confirm. Exit the text editor with Ctrl + X.

Restart the MySQL service for the changes to take effect:

terminal
 sudo service mysql restart

This step is important because you modified the MySQL configuration.

Setting the Root Password
Log in to MySQL as the root user without providing a password:

terminal
sudo mysql -u root -p

Since you've commented out the password, you won't be prompted for a password.

Once logged in, you should see the MySQL prompt. To check the current password policy, run the following command:

terminal
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%';

To set the password policy to "LOW," use the following SQL command:

terminal
SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy = LOW;

Flush the privileges to apply the new password policy:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

To set a password for the root user, use the following SQL command. Replace 'rps@12345' with your desired password:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'rps@12345';

Again, flush the privileges to apply the changes:


FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Exit the MySQL prompt:

11.exit;

You have now configured your MySQL server, set the root password, and adjusted the password policy to "LOW."
